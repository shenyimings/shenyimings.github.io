## Taking Collective Responsibility

​	Ladies and gentlemen. I'm Yiming Shinn, a student at Hainan University. Have you ever heard of Responsibility? Oh, I mean, Collective Responsibility.

​	Every Chinese must have heard these words from childhood to adulthood. In my primary school years and being part of a class for the first time, I was taught to study hard as my grade is not only mine but also on behalf of our whole class.  I need to be responsible for our class as a member. During my high school days as a leader of hygiene in class, the monitor always told me to do better while the hygiene symbolized the collective honor of our class, and this is my duty. In my college life as a class monitor, the sense of responsibility led me to take care when handling class affairs, and check out over and over again. Responsibility is certainly a cultural imprint we all hold as Chinese. This is what I always believe in, responsibility to others and responsibility to myself.

​	Now, in a world with unprecedented opportunities and challenges, what we should do to build a community with a shared future of mankind? 

​	That's what I've been stressing, responsibility. This is engraved in the bones of all Chinese people, the sense of responsibility

​	At the national level, each major country should take up the responsibility of a major power to promote the development of the region, maintain global peace and stability, and jointly protect the environment and the future of mankind.

​	For me, it is to take up the responsibility in my daily life as a member of society. For example, at a time when the epidemic is still rebounding, as a citizen, I should reduce unnecessary travel and cooperate with the government's epidemic prevention policy. As a college student majoring in information security, I should work hard to acquire professional knowledge and contribute to the maintenance of the world's cyber security as soon as possible.

​	Above all is my role in building a community with a shared future for mankind.
