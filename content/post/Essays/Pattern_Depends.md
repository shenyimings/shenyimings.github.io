## Which is more important, the right to privacy or the right to know? 

> - The importance of both depends on your position.

​	For example, in a family where we usually think as children, our right to privacy is more important: our parents **should not break into our rooms at will, should not look through our cell phones or diaries**, and this is the view we have always held. However, ten years from now, or even five years, when we become fathers or mothers, too, will we still think that way like we used to as a child? Things will change when we put ourselves in our parents' shoes and think about this issue again.
​	We love our children and want them to stay on the right track, so we look through their diaries to find out what they are thinking; we love our children and want them to study hard all the time, so we break into their rooms to see if they are studying; we love our children and want them not to be badly led by others, so we go through their phones to evaluate their friends.
​	If I ever become a father, I would like to trample on the right to privacy and shout **long live the right to know!** 

​	So, **different standpoints determine different answers.** What we should do is balance both the rights. We shouldn't demand that children have no reservations nor keep everything away from their parents. What is important is for parents to be good friends to their children, to be able to take the initiative to talk to their parents when they encounter problems, and for both sides to trust each other, so that it is a healthy and good family relationship **without having to care whether they should have the right to know or privacy.**
